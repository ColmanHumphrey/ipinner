You can install from github:

# if not installed:
# install.packages("devtools")

install_github("ColmanHumphrey/ipinner")

If instead you've downloaded the package, you can use the local install:

```r
# this assumes you're in the directory with the package
install.packages("ipinner", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```
